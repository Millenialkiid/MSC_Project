# FS_Project
This project analyzes the power characteristics of 3YSZ (Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia) and Inconel materials using data from a "Pzt.txt" file. It calculates the power per unit mass for 3YSZ and the Joule heating in Inconel, then plots these values against time.

**Functionality:**

* Loads data from a tab-delimited text file ("Pzt.txt").
* Calculates power, current density, electric field, conductivity, and power per unit mass for 3YSZ.
* Calculates Joule heating and Joule heating per unit mass for Inconel.
* Generates a plot of power per unit mass versus time for both materials.
* Saves the plot as "FS_P_vs_time.png".

**Dependencies:**

* Python 3
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Google Colab (for file uploading)

**Usage:**

1. Upload the "Pzt.txt" data file.
2. Run the Python script.
3. The plot will be displayed and saved.

**Potential Applications:**

* Material Science Research
* Fuel Cell Development
* Thermal Management Systems
